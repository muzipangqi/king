      <h2>
        QUOKKA
      </h2>
      <h4>Rottnest Island is a Class A reserve, known for its high conservation and community values, where the most
        iconic animals quokkas live.
        <br>They are cute and cuddly creatures and are known as the happiest animals in the world, there are between
        10,000 and 12,000 live there.</br>
        <br>They are mostly nocturnal, but due to the lack of natural predators on the island, they are also active
        during the day.</br></h4>
      <h3>Here are the best places to see the quokoos:</h3>
      <ul class="center">
        <li>Settlements around bakeries, beaches, hotels and restaurants</li>
        <li>Bike parking near Dolphin Cove</li>
        <li>Under the trees on the hill, walk down Wadjemup Road to the lighthouse</li>
        <li>Near the Garden Lake</li>
        <li>It's on Defense Road, just past Digby Road</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you can get a picture with a quokka at the right angle, <strong>he looks as though he’s smiling into the
          camera!</strong>
        <br> Rottnest Island is highly encouraging of the quokka selfie trend as it helps to promote tourism to the
        island, which in turn generates funds for vital quokka conservation.</br>
        <br>Quokkas are docile, inquisitive, and aren’t afraid of humans, so they don’t appear to be fazed by their
        social media stardom. </br>
        <br>Other areas frequented by the quokkas are around The Basin, Stark Bay headland, Bickley Bay, Parker Point
        and Salmon Point. The scrub around Bathurst Tennis Courts and Pinky’s Beach are also popular spots.</br></p>
