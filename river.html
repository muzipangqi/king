          <h3>Things you didn't know about the swan river</h3>
          <li>Perth locals could have been speaking French: France and Britain had a race to occupy the land by the Swan
            River.</li>
          <li>Western Australia does not have a convict heritage: The Swan River Colony was a representation of change.
          </li>
          <li>The study also found that 68 per cent of West Australians don’t know that stormwater is the leading source
            of pollution in city.</li>
          <li>The Swan River was named by a Dutch explorer: The river was originally named Swarte Swaene-Revier by Dutch
            explorer Willem de Vlamingh in 1697.</li>
          <li>The story of the kissing trees: On the southern shores of the Swan River, there are two old river gum
            branches that are draped next to each other.</li>
          <li>Occupied by a special breed of dolphins: The Swan River is home to the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose dolphins,
            which are a breed of the common bottlenose dolphins. </li>
          <li>Home to over 130 species of fish and wildlife: Both land and water animals call the Swan River home,
            including bull sharks, cobblers and blowfish.</li>
          <li>Flows for a short period of time: The Swan River is an ephemeral river, meaning it flows for shorter
            periods during or after a period of rainfall.</li>

        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem">The Swan begins as the Avon River, rising near Yealering in the Darling Range,
          approximately 175 kilometres (109 mi) from its mouth at Fremantle.
          <br>he Avon flows north, passing through the towns of Brookton, Beverley, York, Northam and Toodyay.
          <br>It is joined by tributaries including the Dale River, the Mortlock River and the Brockman River. </p>

        <h4>Tributaries</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem">More tributaries including Ellen Brook, Jane Brook, Henley Brook, Wandoo Creek,
          Bennett Brook, Blackadder Creek, Limestone Creek, Susannah Brook
          <br> however, most of these have either dried up or become seasonally flowing due to human impacts such as
          land clearing and development.
        </p>

        <h4>Swan coastal plain</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem">Between Perth and Guildford the river goes through several loops. Areas including
          the Maylands Peninsula, Ascot and Burswood, through Claise Brook
          <br>Heirisson Island, upon which The Causeway passes over, was once a collection of small islets known as the
          Heirisson Islands

        <h2>How a littble blue boathouse became selfie spot</h2>
        <h4>
          The power of the hashtag and the 'Asian selfie spot'
        </h4>
        <p>Edith Cowan University digital marketing researcher Violetta Wilk has used the boathouse as a case study for
          organic social media marketing.
          <br>Dr Wilk said the phenomenon of the viral marketing term "Asian selfie spot" — also known by the
          unfortunate acronym ASS
          <br>"Hotspots like this tend to happen organically — trends arise in social media through the engagement, the
          likes, shares and comments," she said.
          <br>"We fuel those trends and they spread like wildfire on social media."
          <br>Dr Wilk said it would be difficult to recreate and market a tourist destination as popular as the
          boathouse.</p>
        <h4>
          Boathouse becomes stock smartphone wallpaper

        <p>Of all the iconic images in this world, it's nice to know there are many millions of people walking around
          with a little piece of WA in their pocket
          <br>Mr Nattrass said his family had been surprised by various requests to use the boathouse.
          br>Social media and smartphones [gaining popularity], Facebook and Instagram have really taken it to a new
          level</p>
