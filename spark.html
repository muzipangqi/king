          <h4>Kings Park Perth WA is a wonderful place to end your day, both as a tourist or a local. <u>During Perth’s
              warm summer months </u> (from November through to March) the city gets very hot.
            <br>However, if you head up to Kings Park in the late afternoon you will often be rewarded with a refreshing
            breeze blowing off the Swan River.</br>
            <br>Without a doubt, Kings Park Western Australia is a perfect place to throw out a picnic rug for some wine
            and cheese, or even use one of the many BBQs around the park.</h4>
          <p>It sounds trite, but every time heading up to Kings Park Perth everyone just love it.
            <br>As the world’s largest inner-city park it offers stunning views of the river, great picnic spots, lots
            of walks
            <br> and best of all solitude. Yes, that is right, it is easy to get out and find corners of the bush in the
            city.

        Aboriginal culture tour
      </h2>
      <h4>The Noongar people are the Aboriginal
        people of Perth region and it is well worth
        taking the time to get to know them and where
        they live.
        <br>Kings Park in Perth has been an
        important place for Aboriginal communities to
        celebrate and create dreams for thousands of
        years.</br>
        <br>The land we know today as Kings Park has been a place of great significance to its traditional custodians,
        The land we know today as Kings Park has been a place of great significance to its traditional custodians,
        <br>the Whadjuk Noongar people, for at least 40,000 years. The Park's traditional names include<span
          style="color:red"> 'Kaarta Koomba', 'Kaarta Gar-up' or 'Mooro Kaarta'.</span> </h4>
      <p>
        As traditional Noongar songs resonate amongst giant eucalypt and other spectacular native species, it’s easy to
        imagine the pristine Derbarl Yerrigan (Swan River) winding its way through the virgin landscape pre
        colonisation. Perth's native flora and city skyline form the beautiful backdrop for this 90 minute walking tour
        through Karrgatup.
        <br> Learn about Kaarta Gar-up, the local Noongar term for the Mt Eliza escarpment in Kings Park, and about Mt
        Eliza’s intriguing past and its spiritual significance to Noongar people.
        <br>The tour begins with a traditional Noongar welcome and ochre ceremony, followed by dreamtime stories and
        songs featuring Indigenous language.

          Kings Park flowers
        </h2>
        <h4>This Western Australian wildflower grows well in most gardens. They have papery flowers and last a long time
          in bloom.</h4>
        <p>Governor Weld gazetted a public park of 432 acres here in 1872. With self-government Premier Forrest added a
          further 450 acres to Mt Eliza Park in 1890 which was renamed Perth Park in 1895.
          <br>In 1901 it was renamed Kings Park when Edward VII ascended to the British throne. A few plantings of trees
          were made including the Avenue of Honour in 1919 for those killed during World War One
          <br>In 1929 the Cenotaph was unveiled in Kings Park. The park did not become a Botanic Garden until 1961 when
          the first director was appointed.The Botanic Gardens officially opened in 1965 with the plantings emphasising
          WA plants and flowers, including many endemic to this area of Perth.
          <br>Kings Park has sandy soils and the 750 mm of annual rainfall soaks away quickly. The Park has a great
          lookout over the city of Perth and the Swan River and another look out for the Lotterywest Federation Walkway.
          <br>In September the Park should have good plantings of several WA wildflowers in garden beds including
          everlastings, kangaroo paws, verticordia etc.</p>
