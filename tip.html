                                <p>Australia uses three main time zones: Western Australian Standard Time (AWST;
                                    UTC+08:00), Australian Central Standard Time (ACST; UTC+09:30) and Australian
                                    Eastern Standard Time (AEST; UTC + 10) [1] The time is set by state governments, and
                                    some states observe daylight Saving Time (DST). Australia's outer territories follow
                                    different time zones. Daylight Saving Time begins at 2am (AEST) on the first Sunday
                                    in October and ends at 3am (Australian Eastern Daylight Time) on the first Sunday in
                                    April.</p>

                                </h2>
                                <p>September to November & March to May are best time to visit Australia. Most of the
                                    tourists opt for these months to visit Australia. The weather during these seasons
                                    is neither too hot nor too cold that makes it perfect to have a walk around
                                    Australia. Be careful a pattern marked by below-normal sea surface temperatures in
                                    the central and eastern Pacific around the equator, is predicted to continue through
                                    the remainder of 2022 and into the start of 2023.</p>

                                <p>Unfortunately, some travellers have their holiday cut short due to illness or
                                    accident. If you take prescribed medication make sure you will have enough for the
                                    duration of your visit and remember to also have a script renewal from your doctor.
                                    When travelling in remote areas always carry adequate supplies of water and a
                                    comprehensive first aid kit. Mosquitoes can carry diseases such as encephalitis and
                                    Ross River fever so use an appropriate insect repellent and cover arms and legs with
                                    loose clothing particularly at dawn and dusk.</p>

                                <p>Travellers should always wear a wide brimmed hat, long-sleeved shirt, sunglasses and
                                    at least an SPF 15+ sunscreen when outdoors and drink plenty of water. It is
                                    recommended that you drink at least two litres each day. Be sure to wear sun
                                    protective clothing, sunscreen, a hat and sunglasses and seek shade to protect your
                                    skin from skin cancer and other sun damage. Take extra care when outdoors between
                                    10.00am and 3.00pm when UV radiation is most intense.
